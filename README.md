# BikeSharingAssignment
Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
The Steps we will follow in this assignment as follow:
1. Reading, understanding and visualising the data
2. Preparing the data for modelling(train-test split,rescaling etc)
3. Training the model
4. Residual analysis
5. Predictions and evaluation
